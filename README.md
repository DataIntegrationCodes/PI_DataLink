Developed a custom PI OSISOFT library to streamline data extraction from a PI Data Archive.
The library supports multi-tag queries and is specifically optimized for pulling only critical key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, which are then loaded into a SQL Server database for performance monitoring. 
The solution also includes a user-friendly Windows Forms application that allows users to query the PI Data Archive and export the results directly to an Excel file.
